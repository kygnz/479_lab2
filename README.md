# Heart and Respiratory Rate Monitor

Your goal in this lab is to develop a wearable chest
strap that monitors the heart rate and the respiratory
rate. 

## Section 0: Display the graphs
- [ ] heart rate
- [ ] respiratory rate
- [ ] inhale/exhale period

## Section 1: Fitness Mode
- [ ] interface should always collect 30-sec of baseline from the user, baseline data would display the resting heart rate and the resting respiratory rate
- [ ] After the initial 30 sec data collection, the interface should display the cardio zone that the user is experiencing
- [ ] activity graph should be color-coded according to the period of the time that the user was at each cardio zone
- [ ] For each cardio zone, your interface, should display the change in the respiratory rate, and the inhalation and respiration duration


## Section 2: Stress Monitoring Mode
- [ ] your interface should always collect 30-sec of baseline data from the user. The baseline data will be used to calculate the resting heart rate and the respiratory rate
- [ ] Can you conclude that the music actually made you more relaxed? IE heart rate should go down when you hear the music and calmness should be detected
- [ ] Can you conclude that a stressful activity actually made you anxious? IE heart rate should go up and stress should be detected

## Section 3: Meditation Monitoring Mode
- [ ] your interface should always collect a 30-sec baseline data from the
user. The baseline data will display the resting heart rate and the respiratory rate of the user
- [ ]  breathe so that your inhalation period is one third of your exhalation period. Your interface should continually check to make sure if this breathing pattern is achieved
- [ ] If for 3 consecutive breaths this criterion is not met an indicator on your interface should be activated

## Section 4: Innovation
- [ ] Simulate an innovative application for this wearable in order to make it more interesting
